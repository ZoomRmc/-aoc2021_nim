AoC 2021 in Nim

## Previous years:
 - [2020](https://github.com/ZoomRmc/aoc2020_nim)

## General notes
What I'm trying to stick to while writing the solutions, in order of importance:
 - Intelligible implementation logic, clear data flow
 - Brevity must not hurt readability
 - Short, self-sustaining functions with evident behaviour, hopefully as "strict" as reasonable
 - Keep the solutions for both parts of the task separated (one should work in case the other was removed from the code), extract repeating computations to functions/templates
 - Use the more suitable data structures available (it's tempting and boring to solve *everything* with Hash Tables)
 - Explore standard library before jumping to external libs
